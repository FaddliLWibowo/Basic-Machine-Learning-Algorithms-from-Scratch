### About
This project was implemented to learn the workings of linear regression and how least squares error is used to model the best fit line

### Results
Blue dots represent the data used for training and red dots represents the prediction for an unknown value
#### Best Fit Line under Low Variance

Slope = 2.080018, y_intercept = -1.335, coeff_of_determination = 0.9469, variance = 8
#### Best Fit Line under High Variance

Slope = 1.847, y_intercept = 1.5402, coeff_of_determination = 0.4072, variance = 50<br />
<br />
For easy visualization 2_dimensional data was choosen
